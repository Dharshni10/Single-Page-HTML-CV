# Single-Page-HTML-CV

Project Live URL: https://dharshni10.github.io/Single-Page-HTML-CV/

This project is a single-page curriculum vitae (CV) built using semantic HTML5. It demonstrates the correct use of structural HTML elements to create a clear, accessible, and well-organized resume layout.

The CV includes essential sections such as profile, education, skills, and career history, and is structured to be easily styled in future projects using CSS.

To improve discoverability and sharing, the project implements SEO meta tags, Open Graph (OG) tags for social media previews, and a favicon for better browser identification.
